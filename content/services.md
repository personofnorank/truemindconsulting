Stand up or refocus a program to deliver your objectives, understanding who the stakeholders are and what they need as well as the way things get done in your organisation.

### Risk and resilience
Build or enhance your organisation's risk management capability by focusing on your purpose, objectives and obligations, and how those are affected by uncertainty. Distinguish between risks worth taking and risks to avoid at all costs.

### Complex situations

Engage me to help you frame, understand and decide what to do about a complex issue. I won't claim to predict the future or solve all your problems but I will help you understand challenges in your environment, internal factors that may make you less effective in adapting, and what you may be able to do about them. 

*Experience with tricky situations and dilemmas ranging from racial equality legislation in South Africa, through competitive challenges in the European payments landscape to work with organisations promoting adaptation to climate change.*
