Economic, social and technological disruption are making the world harder to navigate. The assumptions of multi-year plans, perpetual growth and linear extrapolation of trends no longer hold, if they ever did. 

In a complex and interconnected world, the problems we face don't live in silos - but our thinking all too often does.

I help leaders build greater agency amidst uncertainty by asking big questions around how and for whom they create value, what they need in order to keep doing that from a strategic or operational point of view, the risks to achieving those things as well as opportunities from unexpected sources. 

My approach is both insightful and practical, helping help you see more clearly and do things that matter.
