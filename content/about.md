Economic, social and technological disruption are making the world harder to navigate. The assumptions of multi-year plans, perpetual growth and linear extrapolation of trends may no longer hold, if they ever did. 

In a complex and interconnected world, the problems we face don't live in silos - but our thinking all too often does.

I help organisations build greater agency amidst uncertainty by asking "big picture" questions around how they add value to their customers and stakeholders, what they need in order to keep doing that from an operational or change management point of view, the risks to achieving those things and how to make them more resilient. 

My approach is both insightful and practical, helping help you see more clearly and get things done. What you get with me is not generic “best practice” but true to your unique situation and what you need to move forward.
