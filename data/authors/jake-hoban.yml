  I'm a linguist and translator turned technologist and systems thinker. I've
  been working in small and large companies since 1999, mainly in technology and
  financial services, with roles spanning strategy and operations, change, risk, product and
  program management. I've worked on tricky situations and dilemmas ranging from racial equality legislation in South Africa, through competitive challenges in the European payments landscape to promoting adaptation to climate change.
