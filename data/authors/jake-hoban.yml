  I'm a linguist and translator turned technologist and systems thinker. I've
  been working in small and large companies since 1999, mainly in technology and
  financial services, with roles spanning strategy and operations, change, risk, product and
  program management. My best work has always been on problems that don't sit in
  one silo and that people often don't know how to tackle.
